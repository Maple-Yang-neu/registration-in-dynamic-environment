This folder holds the data from localization method testing.

Records of the arena were obtained in the laboratory of CIIRC in Prague. The arena was build out of cardboard boxes covered with papers and posters to provide the robot with suitable features.

We have recorded 3 sets of runs, each of which consists of 3 measurement. 
	1. the robot driving along the arena loop in counter-clockwise direction
	2. the robot driving along the arena loop in clockwise direction
	3. the robot driving to the other side of the arena and then returning the same way
	
Before the third set of measurements, one poster was changed in the arena and a piece of cardboard was removed (representation of a door).

The datasets are devided in a following way:

The the second set of measurements is the training dataset (makes up the database).

Rest of the measurements are the test dataset (are compared with the database data to get the right position).
